#### What did you do?
bug close 1


#### What did you expect to see?
create file Status with closed or
create file tag_status_closed


#### What did you see instead?
bug close command deletes issues.


#### What version?
0.6


#### Resolution
I added a config value CloseStatusTag.
Default is false, current behavior of removing the issue.
Configured value of true will instead set status to closed.

in the code
     bug.setField wasn't exposed yet.  so I changed it to
     bug.SetField and call it from bugapp/Close.go

     SetField now applies NewFieldLowerCase to keys as well as values

there is no ui for a command to set a "field" value yet.
Tags were originally just present or not.

Tags are now keys and values which are read
but not yet written by the bug command.
