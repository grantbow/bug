status
priority
milestone
identifier

append and collapse these hard coded implementations down to
also read tag_key_value implementations

Quite a lot of code was needed to add this feature.
Adding the reading of both lower case and upper case keys
should add significant ease of use in edge cases inherent
with user-entered content like this.

in the code we call each of status priority milestone and identifier
a "field". These still have significance apart from any other key value pair.

The "tags" are now either a file under /tags/ in the issue directory or
simply tag_key_value (optionally tag_key with value contained in file)
in the issue directory. This speeds up readability for people looking
at the directory.

Using config.TagKeyValue if adding the special four fields via command line
they should now go into tag_key_value format. adding new "tags" with the
configuration will write empty tag_key files already.
I think the UI for entering values would be complicated and confusing
so I will leave that to hand editing the files themselves.
This seems reasonable.

All edge cases are not yet fully tested but I think this will work
even better than I imagined when starting to implement this feature.
