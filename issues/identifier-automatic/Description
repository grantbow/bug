#### What did you do?
bug issue create autoid

#### What did you expect to see?
automatic, incrementing identifier number

#### What did you see instead?
autoid was created but no identifier
configuration should default correctly to not provide one
but it should be clear how to enable this feature

once the setting is enabled two features are needed.

First is the happy path, bug add, assign and increment.

Second is to check that all bugs added, via bug or manually
have an id assigned already. If not, ask to add it.

#### Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
