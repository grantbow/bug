what happened?

text used to describe an issue is currently "bug"

what did you expect?

hoping to get more consistent language for users

what should have happened?

change text to "issue" from "bug" in many places including config file name
sometimes both may be acceptable


accomplished: git mv cmd/bug cmd/fit
    and adjustments
