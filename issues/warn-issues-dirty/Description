#### What did you expect to see?

it depends on how the team member uses git for issue and non-issues.

manual git command `git status issues` will show changes in the filespec
"issues" working directory without affecting the rest of the tree.

it also depends on how the team member updates their issues.

without a warn-issues-dirty feature, then when running bug or git commands
there is no warning that the issues are dirty (updated or added).

For examle, `bug create -n foo` will create the directory and touch Description
but not add the Description file to the git staging area. Also as files under
issues are updated or created these are not automatically added to the working
directory. Updates are easier to catch along with other files already in git.
Getting files into git requires something manual. This gets annoying when
adding many different issue files like I have been doing with this program.

Using `git add -A issues` correctly with a filespec will add all of these at
one time. This assumes all edits under the issues directory should be staged.
I sometimes leave files in my working directories so having a feature to warn
me during `bug list` and perhaps elsewhere would help.
