what it does now: warn of changed files

what it needs to do: identified changed issues (not files)

next: use the list of changes with a notification system for email and/or twilio texts.

functions output []byte of command output with an error.

// scm/GitManager.go
// SCMIssuesUpdaters() ([]byte, error) {
uses
$ git status --porcelain -u -- :/issues
M  issues/changed-issues/Description

// scm/GitManager.go
// SCMIssuesCacher() ([]byte, error) {
uses
$ git diff --name-status --cached HEAD -- :/issues
M       issues/changed-issues/Description

in both cases splitting on / is ok as issues is a known quantity anyway.

should use the same as path/filepath 
constant os.PathSeparator
and not hard code the / of unix.
