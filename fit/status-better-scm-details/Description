#### What did you do?
fit status
fit staging || fit cached


#### What did you expect to see?
the information should be specific and helpful
it isn't easy checking through each hit to know if
it is untracked and/or if it's staged but not yet committed


#### What did you see instead?
output differs. both should be equally helpful


#### What version?


#### notes:
bugapp/Env.go
should have similar code and description to
cmd/fit/main.go
