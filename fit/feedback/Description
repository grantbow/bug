#### What did you do?
bug feedback

#### What did you expect to see?
some way to send feedback (perhaps a bug) or a non-bug to the git repo maintainers

this should be handled by the git repo README and/or other doc files but
having a simple way to send an email may be helpful

#### What did you see instead?
nothing yet
