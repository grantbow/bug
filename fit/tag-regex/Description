what did you do:

bug list bug*

what happened :

Not found bug*

what should happen:

Well, it's user error to use file globbing but
the interpreter doesn't know that before it executes bug.

currently == strings are used in List.go. 
we should match wildcards compiled as a regular expression
if it compiles without error.

Escaping should be used to stop such matching.

solution: bug list --match foo
