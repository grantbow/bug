    people - author
    is

#### What version?



#### notes:
classes of data types are evolving. the "who" and the "what" and the "when" value types.
the "where" and the "why" are somewhat covered by the Description text.
the "how" comes afterward and is more forward looking for issues than
    text describing past or present which makes sense.

status - given a workflow, where along the path is the issue explicitly or implicitly labeled to be

priority - this tries to give some kind of context about the issue regarding ordering compared to other issues
identifier - explicit id of the issue itself

milestone - future or past version of the software itself

the semantics of some of these require coding, especially identifier.

Milestone might be able to be associated with tags in the past but is often a target future implying a deadline for work.

The idea of status with workflow feels like it could be expanded and is important.
one way I am using the fit system now is an implied status of notags which I coded.
