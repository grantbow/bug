#### What did you do?
fit list


#### What did you expect to see?
identifiers used when they are set


#### What did you see instead?
identifiers are not mixed with the natural date ordering sequence number assigned 

this may be a bit tricky and something may be needed to signal in the listing if it's
assigned explicity or implicitly like a () or something

#### What version?
