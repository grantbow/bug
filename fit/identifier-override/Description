#### What did you do?
fit list


#### What did you expect to see?
identifiers used when they are set -- fixed


#### What did you see instead?
identifiers are not mixed with the natural date ordering sequence number assigned  -- fixed
    both numbers work with present implementation

this may be a bit tricky and something may be needed to signal in the listing if it's
assigned explicity or implicitly like a () or something

explicity may be more "natural" and the natural date ordering sequence may change as it's
assigned on each run of the program and relies on the directory date. Perhaps this number
should be highlighted using ().

#### What version?
