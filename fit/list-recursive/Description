$ bug list -r
or
$ bug list --recursive

lists bugs in present issues directory and
all subdirectories of .. that also have an issues directory

I changed a few printing specifics to make it look better

reopened since when in a lower directory there is no indicator
that there may be other directories under the .git directory
exist. This came up with the cmd/fit directory vs. the .git/../fit
