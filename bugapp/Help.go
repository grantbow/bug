it will print any issues which have that tag (in short form).

semantic versioning is a good convention to adopt. Failing that,
it's a good idea to use milestones that collate properly when
sorted as strings so that they appear properly in "%s roadmap".

Milestone file for the issue (creating the file as necessary).

referencing.

By default, no identifiers are set for an issue. This means that
the issue number provided in "%s list" is an index into the directory,
and is unstable as bugs are created, modified, and closed. However,
the benefit is that they are easy to reference and remember, at least
in the short term.

If you have longer lasting issues that need a stable identifier,
they can be created by "%s identifier BugID NewIdentifier" to
set the identifier of BugID to NewIdentifier. From that point
forward, you can use NewIdentifier to reference the bug instead
of the directory index.

There are no rules for what constitutes a valid identifier, but
you should try and ensure that they have at least 1 non-numeric
character so that they don't conflict with directory indexes.

If you just want an identifier but don't care what it is, you
can use "%s identifier BugID --generate" to generate a new
identifier for BugID.

also try and look up the bug by a substring match on all the valid 
identifiers in the system before giving up.
