How to reproduce:

bug close foo

What happened:

rm -rf foo

What should happen:

Default behavior of deleting doesn't support historical lookup.
The issues system may be used as a supplement, not a replacement
for some other issue tracking system.

optionally: bug status close foo

    and/or add a new command 
    bug archive
    could `git mv 1` to another subfolder like issues-archive/1
        to prevent being read as an issue
