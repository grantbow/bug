# Bug

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/driusan/bug?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/driusan/bug) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/driusan/bug.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/driusan/bug) [![Test Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/driusan/bug/branch/master/graphs/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/driusan/bug)

bug writes code problem reports to plain text files.

bug requires Go version 1.9 or greater.

Bug is an implementation of a distributed issue tracker using
git (or hg) to manage issues on the filesystem following [poor man's
issue tracker](https://github.com/driusan/PoormanIssueTracker) conventions.

Bug can be aliased as a git subcommand `bug` or `issue`. 

The goal is to use the filesystem in a human readable way, similar to
how an organized person without any bug tracking software might, 
by keeping track of bugs in an `issues/` directory, one (descriptive)
subdirectory per issue. bug provides a tool to maintain the nearest 
`issues/` directory to your current working directory and provides hooks 
to commit (or remove) the issues from source control.

An optional config file next to the issues directory named .bug.yml may
specify options like a file to use as a default Description text.

This differs from other distributed bug tracking tools, (which usually 
store a database in a hidden directory) in that you can still easily 
view, edit, or understand bugs even without access to the bug tool. bug
only acts as a way to streamline the process of maintaining them. Another 
benefit is that you can also have multiple `issues/` directories at 
different places in your directory tree to, for instance, keep separate 
bug repositories for different submodules or packages contained in a 
single git repository.

Because issues are stored as human readable plaintext files, they branch
and merge along with the rest of your code, and you can resolve conflicts 
using your standard tools.

# Installation
If you have go installed, install the latest released version with:

`go get github.com/driusan/bug`

Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` are in your path (or copy
the "bug" binary somewhere that is.)

Otherwise, you can download a 64-bit release for OS X or Linux on the 
[releases](https://github.com/driusan/bug/releases/) page.

(The latest development version is on the latest v0.x-dev branch)

# Sample Usage

If an environment variable named PMIT is set, that directory will be
used to create and maintain issues, otherwise the bug command will
walk up the tree until it finds somewhere with a subdirectory named
"issues" to track issues in.

Some sample usage (assuming you're already in a directory tracked by
git):

```
$ mkdir issues
$ bug help
Usage: bug command [options]

Use "bug help [command]" for more information about any command below
